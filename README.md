Hello! 

This is a project showcasing my attempt at the CloudResumeChallenge https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/ . It is a resume project designed to help build skills that are necessary for a career in cloud or DevOps

Below are the tools I used: 
S3
AWS CloudFront
AWS Lambda
Dynamo DB
Certificate Manager
Terraform
GitHub Actions

You can also find a detailed explanation of how I went about the challenge on my LinkedIn [www.linkedin.com/in/musayyib-yusuf-9b9b53216](https://www.linkedin.com/in/musayyib-yusuf-9b9b53216/)

You can access a live demo of the resume itself at [resume.musayyib.com](https://resume.musayyib.com/). However, if you are seeing this at a later date when the AWS free tier on my account has expired you can still access my portfolio resume at https://www.musayyib.com
